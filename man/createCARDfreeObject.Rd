  markerList,
  spatial_count,
  spatial_location,
  minCountGene = 100,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{markerList}{a list of marker genes, with each element of the list being the vector of cell type specific marker genes}

\item{spatial_count}{Raw spatial resolved transcriptomics data, each column is a spatial location, and each row is a gene.}

\item{spatial_location}{data frame, with two columns representing the x and y coordinates of the spatial location. The rownames of this data frame should match eaxctly with the columns of the spatial_count.}

\item{minCountGene}{Minimum counts for each gene}

\item{minCountSpot}{Minimum counts for each spatial location}
}
\value{
Returns CARDfree object with filtered spatial count and marker gene list.
